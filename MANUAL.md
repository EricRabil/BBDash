## Requirements

BBDash only runs on Chromium-based browser at the moment, like Chrome, Brave, and Microsoft Edge. We are planning to support more browsers in the near future.

## Installing

You can install BBDash from the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bbdash/geddgcpneoejfjekjbgpnghhmgahcpgj) or manually by grabbing the latest development build [from our website](https://bbdash.app/downloads).
